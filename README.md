# Khazadlab

## Introduction

Welcome to my homelab! Everything runs on **Kubernetes k3s**, with services managed by:
- **Traefik**  
- **Keycloak**  
- **Longhorn**  
- **Plex**  
- **Home Assistant**  
- and more.

The single master node is a **BMAX B3 Mini PC** (Windows 11, Intel N5095, 8 GB DDR4 RAM, 256 GB SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, 1000 Mbps Ethernet).
Also, Iâ€™ve configured my DIGI router accordingly and set up a DuckDNS DDNS to ensure consistent access.
